<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a secret voting MVP into a production-ready application, focusing on a modern stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) and implementing core features like real-time updates, PDF reports with data deletion, and a responsive glassmorphic UI. Key achievements included robust load testing for hundreds of participants, a comprehensive Scrutator (observer) feature with secure code generation, organizer approval, and majority-vote PDF generation requiring significant refactoring. The engineer also refined poll result displays for participants (post-closure only), fixed a critical tie-breaking bug, completed extensive repository cleanup, and implemented a participant notification/redirection system upon meeting closure. Most recently, a detailed, technically precise information modal was added to the homepage, and an extreme backend load test was successfully conducted, validating the system's scalability.

<product_requirements>
The application, Vote Secret, enables anonymous voting for assemblies, providing distinct organizer and participant interfaces.
**Problem:** To facilitate secure, anonymous, and verifiable voting, addressing issues of transparency, data ephemerality, and user trust.
**Organizer Interface:** Organizers create meetings, manage participant approvals, and define/manage polls with timers. They view real-time results and generate PDF reports (approved participants, aggregated results), which automatically deletes meeting data. The UI is clean, with a prominent meeting code and modal-based interactions. A key feature is Scrutators (authorized observers) who join via special codes, require organizer approval, and whose majority vote is required for PDF report generation, ensuring legitimacy.
**Participant Interface:** Participants join by name/ID, await approval, vote anonymously, and view poll results *only after* closure. For active polls, they see vote counts and elapsed time. Upon meeting closure via report generation, participants are notified and redirected to the homepage.
**Core Requirements:** Strict anonymity, ephemeral data (deleted post-PDF), real-time updates, modern responsive UI (blue/light, glassmorphism, no grey), production readiness with HTTPS. A new requirement includes a detailed information modal on the homepage explaining system legitimacy and data handling.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Architecture:** React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets for live updates.
-   **Anonymity & Data Privacy:** UUIDs, cryptographic data deletion post-PDF.
-   **PDF Generation:** Backend processing for reports.
-   **Modern UI/UX:** Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, Glassmorphism.
-   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose (Nginx, Certbot).
-   **Advanced Authentication/Authorization:** Custom token/name-based access for Scrutators.
-   **State Management:** React hooks for UI logic.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture with separate  and  services, configured for containerized deployment using Docker.



-   : Core FastAPI backend.
    -   Importance: Handles all API logic for meetings, participants, polls, real-time updates, PDF generation, and data deletion.
    -   Changes: Implemented Scrutator functionality (new models, approval logic, majority vote for PDF). Updated poll result logic for participants (active vs. closed). Fixed tie-breaking bug. Added WebSocket event for  to notify participants.
-   : Main React component.
    -   Importance: Manages UI rendering, routing, state, and API interactions for both organizer and participant interfaces.
    -   Changes: Extensively refactored for Scrutator feature (state, functions, UI elements). Modified poll result display for participants. Fixed tie-breaking UI display. Implemented  state, , and  for participant notification/redirection. Added  state and a detailed  component on the homepage, which was later refined for technical precision and guarantees.
-   : Global/component styles.
    -   Importance: Defines the visual appearance of the application.
    -   Changes: Implemented modern UI/UX with glassmorphism, responsiveness, and a light/white theme, removing grey elements.
-   : Testing log and protocol.
    -   Importance: Documents testing results and guidelines.
    -   Changes: Continuously updated with backend and frontend test outcomes, including comprehensive load tests, scrutator functionality, bug fixes, repository cleanup summary, and detailed documentation of the new info modal.

-   Ensure the meeting cannot be closed by the organizer if the final report has not been downloaded. (This was explicitly requested by the user and checked for, but no implementation or confirmation of completion was provided in the trajectory).

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed an extreme backend load test (Chat Message 142-145). This test involved simulating 4 simultaneous assemblies, 288 participants, 13 scrutators, 18 polls, and 467 concurrent votes, validating the application's performance and stability under heavy load with a 100% success rate. Prior to this, the engineer significantly enhanced the homepage's informational modal, making its language more technically precise and adding crucial security guarantees (Chat Message 124-141). This included explaining cryptographic dissociation, immutable polls, scrutator majority vote for reports, and overall integrity guarantees. Earlier, a comprehensive repository cleanup was performed (Chat Message 28-41), and the participant notification and redirection system upon meeting closure was fully implemented and tested (Chat Message 79-103), along with fixing a critical tie-breaking bug in poll results.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to implement the protection preventing organizers from closing a meeting before the report is downloaded. The organizer must have the capacity to return to the dashboard if he closes his browser tab, this can be done whit a special url or a unique code to use in the «create a meeting» card.
