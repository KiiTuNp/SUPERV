The previous AI engineer meticulously evolved a secret voting MVP into a production-ready application. Initially, this involved migrating to a modern stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB), implementing core features like real-time updates, PDF report generation with data deletion, and a comprehensive UI/UX redesign featuring responsiveness and glassmorphism. Deployment readiness was a significant focus, integrating Docker, Nginx, and Certbot for HTTPS.

Subsequent work was highly responsive to user feedback and rigorous testing. The engineer successfully conducted extensive backend and frontend load tests, validating the application's robustness for hundreds of participants. A major Scrutator (observer) feature was designed and implemented, including backend models, frontend UI for management, secure code generation, organizer approval for scrutators, and a critical majority-vote system for PDF report generation. This required significant refactoring in  and . Additionally, the display of poll results for participants was refined to only show results post-closure, while organizers retained real-time visibility. A critical bug related to declaring winners in case of a tie was identified and fixed, ensuring mathematically correct poll outcomes. The work consistently involved iterative refinement, thorough testing, and addressing complex logic challenges to meet evolving product requirements.

<product_requirements>
The application facilitates secret voting for assemblies with distinct organizer and participant interfaces, prioritizing anonymity, real-time updates, and a modern, responsive UI.

**Organizer Interface:** Organizers can create meetings with unique IDs, manage participant approvals, create and manage polls (with timers, launch/close functionality), view real-time results, and generate PDF reports containing approved participants and aggregated poll results, which triggers automatic meeting data deletion. The UI emphasizes clarity with a full-width header, prominent meeting code, modal-based poll creation/management, participant counts, and a clear report generation button. A key addition is the Scrutator feature, allowing organizers to invite authorized observers to the organizer interface via a special code, with their names included in the PDF report. Scrutators require organizer approval to join, and PDF generation requires majority approval from approved scrutators.

**Participant Interface:** Participants join meetings by name/ID, await approval, vote anonymously, and view poll results only *after* a poll is closed. For active polls, they should see the number of votes cast and elapsed time. Upon meeting closure via report generation, participants should be notified and redirected to the homepage.

**Core Requirements:** Strict anonymity, ephemeral data (deleted post-PDF download), real-time updates, a modern, responsive UI (blue/light theme, glassmorphism, no grey elements), prominent Join Meeting access, and up-to-date tech stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB). The application must be production-ready with HTTPS deployment.

-   : Core FastAPI backend.
    -   Importance: Handles all API logic for meetings, participants, polls, real-time updates, PDF generation, and data deletion.
    -   Changes: Heavily modified to implement Scrutator functionality (new models for ,  fields for approval status, vote counts for PDF,  flag). New endpoints for adding, retrieving, joining as, approving, declining scrutators, and voting on report generation. Logic updated for PDF generation to include scrutator list, and to require majority scrutator approval before generating. Poll result logic updated to provide different data for active vs. closed polls for participants. Fixed bug where a winner was declared in case of tie. Removed  field from Poll models and creation logic.
-   : Main React component.
    -   Importance: Manages UI rendering, routing, state, and API interactions. It contains the logic for both organizer and participant interfaces.
    -   Changes: Extensively refactored for Scrutator feature: new state variables (, , , , , ), functions for managing scrutators (, , , , , ). Added Ajouter des scrutateurs button and associated modal. Modified  to handle scrutator login.  updated to handle scrutator-specific messages.  logic modified to trigger scrutator vote modal. Report generation card hidden for scrutators. Participant management modal updated to show pending scrutators.
    -   Poll result display for participants was significantly altered:  updated to fetch participant-specific data, and display logic in  now shows vote counts/elapsed time for active polls, and full results only for closed polls.
    -    option removed from organizer's poll creation modal.
    -   Critical bug fix for tie-breaking logic in 's poll results display, adding ⚖️ Égalité badge.
-   : Global/component styles.
    -   Importance: Defines the visual appearance of the application.
    -   Changes: Modified to implement modern UI/UX (gradients, glassmorphism, responsiveness) with specific instructions to remove grey elements and enforce a light/white theme for all cards and elements.
-   : Testing log and protocol.
    -   Importance: Documents testing results and guidelines.
    -   Changes: Continuously updated with backend and frontend test outcomes, confirming successful feature implementations and bug fixes, including comprehensive load tests and new scrutator functionality tests.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a massive and exhaustive frontend test, simulating three simultaneous assemblies, each with over 150 participants, multiple polls, and several scrutators. This test successfully validated the application's performance and stability under extreme load, confirming its readiness for large-scale production deployments.

Prior to this comprehensive test, a critical bug related to the poll result logic, specifically in handling tie-breaking scenarios, was identified and fixed. Previously, the application would incorrectly declare a single winner even when multiple options had an equal, highest number of votes. The fix ensures that a winner is declared only if an option has *strictly more* votes than all others; otherwise, an Equality status is displayed in the UI. This fix was rigorously tested on the backend across five different tie scenarios and was validated to be completely resolved, with no regressions introduced.

The work on implementing a real-time notification and redirection system for participants upon meeting closure (after the organizer downloads the final report) was initiated but then deprioritized due to the user's shift in focus to extensive load testing and the implementation of the complex scrutator feature. This task involved adding state variables like , , and  in  and a  hook to manage the countdown and redirection. However, its full implementation and testing were not completed in the trajectory.
