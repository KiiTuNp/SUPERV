<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic secret voting MVP into a feature-rich, production-ready application. Initial efforts focused on modernizing the tech stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB), implementing core features like real-time updates, PDF report generation with data deletion, and a comprehensive UI/UX redesign featuring responsiveness, vibrant colors, and glassmorphism. Deployment readiness was a major theme, with new Docker production configurations, Nginx, and Certbot for HTTPS, along with detailed documentation.

Subsequent work was heavily driven by user feedback. The AI engineer successfully conducted comprehensive backend (20/21 tests passed) and frontend (11/11 tests passed) testing. UI/UX was iteratively refined, addressing specific user requests to remove grey elements and adopt a serious blue, light, and clean theme across all interfaces (home, organizer, participant). This involved significant refactoring of  and , including reorganizing the organizer dashboard with modals, prominent meeting codes, and revised participant displays. A critical bug with PDF report download, including data deletion and participant redirection, was identified and resolved by fixing the frontend API call and ensuring proper state management. The current task involves implementing real-time participant notification and redirection upon meeting closure, a feature currently being worked on.

<product_requirements>
The goal is a secret voting application for assemblies with distinct organizer and participant interfaces, emphasizing anonymity, real-time updates, and a modern UI.

**Organizer Interface:** Create meetings (unique IDs), approve/reject participants, create polls (with timers), launch/close polls, view real-time results (with participant visibility control), and generate PDF reports (approved participants, aggregated poll results) that trigger automatic meeting data deletion. Polls remain visible until report generation. The user later requested the organizer interface to be serious, clear, and efficient, with a full-width header, prominent meeting code, grouped poll creation/management accessible via modal, participant count (approved/pending) in the header with a Manage participants button, and the report generation as a button at the bottom.

**Participant Interface:** Join meetings by name/ID, undergo approval, vote anonymously, and view poll results post-vote (unless real-time display is enabled). Participants should be notified and redirected when a meeting closes after report generation.

**Core Requirements:** Strict anonymity (no user-vote linkage), ephemeral data (deleted post-PDF download), real-time updates, a modern, responsive, visually appealing UI (colorful, glassmorphism, clear hierarchy, no grey), prominent Join Meeting and discreet Organizer access, and up-to-date dependencies (React, Node, MongoDB, FastAPI latest versions). The application needs a clean, production-ready codebase with HTTPS deployed on . UI color scheme shifted from vibrant purple to serious blue tones, with all cards and elements requiring a light/white background, and the meeting code in the organizer header needs an orange/purple contrast.

- : Core FastAPI backend.
  - Importance: Handles all API logic for meetings, participants, polls, real-time updates, PDF generation, and data deletion.
  - Changes: Modified for PDF generation ( endpoint changed from POST to GET to align with frontend), concurrent vote handling, and data deletion after report download.
- : Main React component.
  - Importance: Manages UI rendering, routing, state, and API interactions. It contains the logic for both organizer and participant interfaces.
  - Changes: Extensively refactored for UI/UX enhancements (removing grey, adopting blue/light theme), implementing glassmorphism, participant result visibility, and form handling. Major structural changes in the organizer dashboard (tabs replaced by modals, re-arrangement of elements). Implemented dynamic text for organizer header, PDF download logic, and participant meeting closure notifications/redirection. Fixed numerous JSX and styling issues.
- : Global/component styles.
  - Importance: Defines the visual appearance of the application.
  - Changes: Heavily modified to implement modern UI/UX (gradients, glassmorphism, responsiveness) with specific instructions to remove grey elements and enforce a light/white theme for all cards and elements. New styles were added for specific UI states like winning poll options.
- , , : Project documentation.
  - Importance: Provides setup, architecture, Docker guides, and production-specific deployment instructions.
  - Changes: Overwritten/updated to reflect current setup.
- : New file created for detailed step-by-step deployment.
  - Importance: Provides a complete guide for deploying the application in a production environment.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the ongoing file cleanup in the root directory and subdirectories, ensuring only necessary files for application functionality and deployment remain. (This task was deprioritized due to user's focus shift to deployment and UI).
- Continue working on the participant notification and redirection when a meeting is closed, ensuring the countdown and automatic redirect to the homepage.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently working on implementing a real-time notification system for participants when an organizer closes a meeting by downloading the final report. This notification should inform participants that the meeting has ended and all data has been deleted, followed by an automatic redirection to the homepage after 10 seconds.

Specifically, the AI engineer has:
1.  Identified existing WebSocket and polling mechanisms in  that can be leveraged.
2.  Added new state variables in  to manage the meeting closed message (, ) and the redirection countdown ().
3.  Modified the  function in  to trigger a message indicating the meeting closure for participants (though the mechanism for this trigger is still being refined).
4.  Updated  and  functions within  in  to detect when a meeting no longer exists (e.g., due to organizer deletion via report download). If a meeting is detected as closed, it sets the  state.
5.  Implemented a  hook to manage the , decrementing it every second and redirecting the user to the homepage when it reaches zero.
6.  Added a new UI block at the beginning of the  component to display the Meeting Closed message with the countdown.

The last action in the trajectory involved identifying and correcting a bad reference in the code related to this new feature and planning a full backend test to simulate the scenario.
