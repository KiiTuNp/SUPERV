<analysis>
The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Vote Secret MVP to a production-ready state, implementing critical features and refining existing ones. Initially, the focus was on core functionalities like Scrutator integration, real-time updates, PDF generation with data deletion, and a responsive UI. The engineer addressed complex requirements such as tie-breaking, participant notifications, and a detailed information modal. The trajectory then pivoted to a major overhaul concerning meeting recovery, organizer absence handling, and a robust cleanup/deployment system. Significant effort was dedicated to implementing password-protected recovery URLs, background cleanup tasks, and enhancing the frontend UI for these features. Most recently, the engineer concentrated on optimizing project dependencies, restructuring the codebase for deployment, and creating a comprehensive, interactive Python-based deployment system, which was then thoroughly tested.

<product_requirements>
The Vote Secret application facilitates anonymous, secure voting for assemblies. Its core problem is enabling transparent, verifiable voting with strict data ephemerality and user trust. The **Organizer Interface** allows meeting creation, participant/scrutator management (with approval for both), real-time poll monitoring, and generation of PDF reports (approved participants, aggregated results), which triggers automatic meeting data deletion. A critical Scrutator feature requires majority observer approval for report generation. The **Participant Interface** enables joining by name/ID, voting anonymously, and viewing poll results only post-closure. Upon meeting closure, participants are notified and redirected. Key requirements include strict anonymity, ephemeral data, real-time updates, a modern responsive UI (blue/light, glassmorphism), and production readiness with HTTPS. Recent additions include a detailed homepage information modal and new recovery features for organizers, including recovery URLs, and a system to manage organizer absence and transfer leadership to scrutators.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a standard full-stack architecture with distinct  and  services, prepared for containerized deployment.



-   : This is the core FastAPI backend. It handles all API logic for meetings, participants, polls, real-time updates via WebSockets, PDF generation, and data deletion. Significant changes include Scrutator functionality, updated poll result logic, tie-breaking bug fixes, and the implementation of a comprehensive meeting recovery system with organizer presence monitoring, background cleanup tasks, and meeting closure protection tied to PDF download. New endpoints for recovery URLs and organizer presence were added.
-   : The main React component managing UI rendering, routing, state, and API interactions. It was extensively refactored for the Scrutator feature and now includes a sophisticated system for organizer meeting recovery (password-protected URLs, heartbeat for presence, handling of organizer absence), and the  on the homepage. The recovery functionality was moved from the Create Meeting card to the Organizer Interface card for improved UX. WebSocket handling was updated for new events like organizer absence and leadership transfer.
-   : Defines the visual appearance. While mentioned as important for UI/UX, no specific direct edits were noted in the trajectory provided.
-   : Documents testing results and guidelines. Continuously updated with backend and frontend test outcomes.

<current_work>
Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the project's deployability and maintainability. This involved a major cleanup of the project's root directory, removing unnecessary files (like Docker-related development files). Concurrently, the engineer addressed dependency optimization for both frontend () and backend (), resolving compatibility issues with various libraries (e.g., , , , ) to ensure a smooth build process.

The most significant recent work involved developing a comprehensive, interactive Python-based deployment system. This system consists of multiple scripts (, , , , ) designed to guide the user through server preparation, prerequisite installation, application deployment, web server optimization (Nginx), and systemd service configuration. This system also integrates the functionality of the previously created  script for environment variable generation. Additionally, new documentation files (, ) were created to support this deployment process. The last action performed was testing this newly created deployment system, which showed a high success rate.

<optional_next_step>
Test the Vote Secret application itself to identify potential improvements and ensure full functionality after the deployment system tests.
