The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Vote Secret MVP to a production-ready state, focusing on core features and then tackling complex deployment challenges. Initially, work revolved around implementing Scrutator, real-time updates, PDF generation, and a robust meeting recovery system. The major thrust involved creating a comprehensive, interactive Python-based deployment system. This system faced significant issues related to MongoDB installation, Nginx SSL configuration order, and SystemD service setup. The engineer diligently debugged these, often iterating with specific user feedback on errors. A critical turning point was realizing the discrepancy between the intended VPS deployment environment (with SystemD) and the current containerized environment (with Supervisor), leading to the development of supervisor-compatible tools and an adaptable deployment script. The engineer meticulously cleaned the codebase, consolidated documentation, and ultimately returned to refining the SystemD setup for the target Ubuntu VPS environment, ensuring an interactive and resilient deployment process.

<product_requirements>
The Vote Secret application provides an anonymous and secure voting platform for assemblies, emphasizing transparency, verifiability, and strict data ephemerality.
**Core Features:**
*   **Organizer Interface:** Allows creating meetings, managing participants and scrutators (with approval), real-time poll monitoring, and generating PDF reports. Report generation triggers automatic data deletion, ensuring ephemerality.
*   **Scrutator Feature:** Requires a majority of observers to approve report generation, adding a layer of verification.
*   **Participant Interface:** Enables anonymous joining via name/ID, secure voting, and viewing poll results only after closure. Participants are notified and redirected upon meeting closure.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Utilizes WebSockets for live status and result updates.
*   **Data Privacy:** Implements UUIDs and cryptographic data deletion.
*   **User Experience:** Features a modern, responsive UI (blue/light theme, glassmorphism using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI).
*   **Production Readiness:** Designed for HTTPS and robust deployment.
**Recent Enhancements & Problem Solving:**
*   **Information Modal:** A detailed modal added to the homepage.
*   **Organizer Recovery:** Implemented password-protected recovery URLs, a heartbeat system for organizer presence, and logic for handling organizer absence (including leadership transfer to scrutators).
*   **Deployment System:** Development of a comprehensive, interactive Python-based deployment system to handle server preparation, prerequisite installation, application deployment, Nginx configuration, and service management. This system was extensively debugged to address issues with MongoDB installation, Nginx SSL certificate order, and SystemD service configuration across different environments (containerized vs. Ubuntu VPS).

-   The previous AI engineer was explicitly tasked by the user to ensure the deployment script is efficient, transparent, interactive, restartable, creates a graceful SystemD service for the backend, places the frontend build in , places the app in  (with backend in ), and ensures correct user ownership and permissions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively addressing critical issues related to the application's deployment system, specifically focusing on making it robust and adaptable for a target Ubuntu VPS environment, while also ensuring the system is functional in the current containerized environment.

The work revolved around resolving persistent service failed errors during deployment. Initially, the AI identified issues with MongoDB installation commands and Nginx configuration order (SSL certificates being referenced before they exist). These were largely resolved by refining , , and  to ensure proper installation sequences and interactive prompts. A major architectural adjustment was made in  to generate two Nginx configurations (temporary HTTP and final SSL) to correctly handle the SSL certificate provisioning process with Certbot.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to SystemD service configuration for the backend. The AI diagnosed missing Gunicorn configuration and path inconsistencies for logs, which were fixed in  and .

A crucial pivot occurred when the  revealed that the current development environment uses Supervisor, not SystemD, leading to service startup failures. The AI then created  and  to manage services via Supervisor for the current environment and updated the  to reflect these tools and environmental considerations.

Most recently, the user clarified that the SystemD issues were relevant for a *target Ubuntu VPS deployment*. This led the AI to revise  again, simplifying the SystemD service configuration to be more robust for standard Ubuntu VPS deployments, inspired by a ChatGPT example. The AI also began adding a deployment mode selection feature in  to make the deployment scripts more adaptable to different target environments.

The current state is that the core deployment scripts (especially , , , ) have undergone significant refactoring to handle MongoDB installation, Nginx SSL setup, Gunicorn configuration, and SystemD service definition more robustly and interactively, with an added mechanism to select deployment mode. The codebase has also been cleaned, and  updated to be the single source of comprehensive documentation.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue refining the deployment scripts to ensure the new SystemD configuration for Ubuntu VPS is fully implemented and tested, and that the deployment process meets all user requirements, including pathing and permissions.
