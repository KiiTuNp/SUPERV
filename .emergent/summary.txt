The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Vote Secret MVP to a production-ready state, overcoming significant deployment hurdles. The work initially focused on core application features like Scrutator and meeting recovery. The main challenge then shifted to building a robust, interactive Python-based deployment system. This system faced recurring issues with MongoDB installation, Nginx SSL configuration order, and SystemD service setup. The engineer meticulously debugged, often iterating with specific user feedback on errors, and adapted the deployment process to handle discrepancies between the current containerized (Supervisor) and target Ubuntu VPS (SystemD) environments. Key fixes included: refining Nginx configurations for proper SSL certificate handling, correcting SystemD service files for Uvicorn (switching from Gunicorn), ensuring proper application and frontend build paths ( and ), and addressing  URL issues. The engineer created numerous diagnostic and repair scripts to aid troubleshooting and validated the backend's functionality. The final state indicates a fully operational application and robust, environment-adaptive deployment scripts.

<product_requirements>
The Vote Secret application provides an anonymous and secure voting platform for assemblies, emphasizing transparency, verifiability, and strict data ephemerality. Its core features include an Organizer Interface for creating meetings, managing participants/scrutators, real-time poll monitoring, and generating PDF reports that trigger automatic data deletion. A Scrutator feature requires a majority of observers to approve report generation for added verification. The Participant Interface allows anonymous joining, secure voting, and viewing results post-closure, with real-time updates via WebSockets. Data privacy is ensured through UUIDs and cryptographic deletion. The UI is modern and responsive, utilizing Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI. Recent enhancements include a detailed information modal, organizer recovery (password-protected URLs, heartbeat, leadership transfer logic), and a comprehensive, interactive Python-based deployment system. This deployment system was critically debugged to resolve issues with MongoDB installation, Nginx SSL certificate order, and SystemD service configuration across different environments (containerized vs. Ubuntu VPS).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets for live updates.
-   **Anonymity & Data Privacy**: UUIDs, cryptographic data deletion.
-   **Deployment Orchestration**: Custom Python scripts for interactive deployment.
-   **Server Management**: SystemD (target production VPS) and Supervisor (current development environment).
-   **Web Server**: Nginx for serving frontend and proxying backend.
-   **Backend Server**: Uvicorn (recently switched from Gunicorn).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a modular full-stack architecture, separating frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) services, designed for containerized deployment but with recent focus on robust native server deployment for a VPS.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   : Core FastAPI backend. The  endpoint was confirmed to exist but required a correct path prefix  during testing.
*   : Main React component. The key change was modifying line 15 (/api) to handle  without a trailing , preventing  double prefixes in API calls.
*   : Crucial for logging test outcomes, bug identification, and fix validation throughout the development process.

<pending_tasks>
-   The previous AI engineer was explicitly tasked by the user to ensure the deployment script is efficient, transparent, interactive, restartable, creates a graceful SystemD service for the backend, places the frontend build in , places the app in  (with backend in ), and ensures correct user ownership and permissions. Based on the last messages, these tasks appear to have been completed and validated.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing critical deployment issues to ensure the Vote Secret application is production-ready for a target Ubuntu VPS, while also confirming its functionality in the current containerized environment. The primary focus was resolving SystemD service failures and an incorrect backend URL prefix.

The AI corrected  to generate the  *without* a trailing  (e.g.,  instead of ). This fixed the  error. Crucially, the SystemD service configuration in  was updated to explicitly use  (on port 8001), replacing , and ensuring the correct module and port for the FastAPI application.  was also modified to install  as a dependency and to ensure the frontend  output is copied to the specified  directory, and the application's core files to . Nginx configurations were reviewed and corrected to serve the frontend from .

The engineer created  and  to provide immediate solutions for these issues on existing deployments. After these corrections, the backend was successfully validated via health checks and functional tests. The core nuance was distinguishing between the current Supervisor-based development environment (where the app was already running) and the SystemD-based target Ubuntu VPS environment, for which the deployment scripts were being meticulously refined. The AI declared the issues resolved, providing clear instructions for future deployments on a real VPS.
